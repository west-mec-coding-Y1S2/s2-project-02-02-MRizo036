        <h2>History </h2>

        <p>Since its inception in 2004, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving 100 runners to a signature
            Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually. The event is enormously effective in spreading the message
            that breast cancer need not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and breast self-exam. As well as
            a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event attracting many first timers and recreational
            runners. This event provides all of us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to
            our families and our communities. </p>

        <h2>Remembering Diane </h2>

        <p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of 2 and wife of Peter, who passed away in May, 2003.
            Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew
            her and continues to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.</p>
        <p>We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.</p>
