        <h2 id="faq1">How do I sign up?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq1"></a> Go to our online form where you can enter your registration information. Remember that the registration
            desk is closed the night before the event.</p>

        <h2 id="faq2">What is the minimum fund-raising total I have to raise? </h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq2"></a> There is no minimum sponsorship target. Any total will help in the cause. Just try and raise as much as
            you can.
        </p>

        <h2 id="faq3">Will I receive a shirt to wear at the race?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq3"></a> Yes! We will be sending out a state of the art running vest or T-shirt to you in the post about a month
            before race day. Please remember to specify which vest or T-shirt size you would like when confirming your place.</p>
        <h2 id="faq4">When will my registration pack arrive?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq4"></a> We will mail out your registration pack in the post within two weeks of your registration. If you have not
            received the pack within that time, please contact us.</p>

        <h2 id="faq5">What does it cost to register?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq5"></a> $35 for the 5K/10K race. The 1-Mile Fun Runs are free. What happens during the race? Please visit the Race
            Info page for all details on what to expect on race day. </p>
        <h2 id="faq6">What happens during the race?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq6"></a> Please visit the Race Info page for all details on what to expect on race day.</p>
        <h2 id="faq7">Will the race be cancelled if it rains?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq7"></a> This event will occur rain or shine. We suggest ponchos and rain gear if it does happen to rain. All registration
            fees and donations are non-refundable in the event of rain.</p>
        <h2 id="faq8">Do I need to register my child?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq8"></a> Yes, if your child is participating in the 5K/10K races. There is no need to register children for the 1
            Mile Fun Run.
        </p>
        <h2 id="faq9">Can I bring my pet?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq9"></a> Pets are discouraged at the race. There are over 2000 people competing in the race and it is too crowded
            to accommodate pets.
        </p>
        <h2 id="faq10">Where do I park?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq10"></a> The earlier you arrive at the race site, the easier parking will be! You may park on the streets as long
            as you are not blocking driveways or residential streets. We encourage you to carpool with your team or other
            participants if possible.</p>
        <h2 id="faq11">Can I collect sponsorship online?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq11"></a> Yes. You can sign up at several web charity organizers and follow their easy step by step guide to create
            your own online fund-raising page. All money raised through your page will be automatically sent through to us
            and allocated to your record.</p>
        <h2 id="faq12">How do I withdraw from the event?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq12"></a> The registration pack will include an official event magazine with withdrawal instructions. Complete the
            withdrawal form and send it to the race organizers along with the race gear and timing chip. A $10 organizational
            fee will be charged to all withdrawals.</p>
        <h2 id="faq13">I am looking for accommodation for the event, where is best to stay?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="#faq13"></a> We are partnering with the Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce to direct visiting runners for places to stay. Low-cost
            camping is available in Prairie Park.</p>
